# High-Availability-Web-Server-Setup-with-HAProxy-Load-Balancer

      Design and implement a high availability web server infrastructure using two identical Apache servers and an HAProxy container. The HAProxy container will be     responsible for distributing incoming HTTP traffic to the Apache servers in a round-robin fashion, ensuring efficient load balancing and high availability.


Project Components:

  1) Apache Servers:
  
  Deploy two identical Apache server instances to handle web requests.
  Configure Apache servers to serve a sample website or application.
  
  2) HAProxy Container:
  Set up an HAProxy container to act as a load balancer.
  Implement round-robin load balancing to evenly distribute incoming HTTP requests to the Apache servers.
  Configure health checks to monitor the status of Apache servers and redirect traffic accordingly.
